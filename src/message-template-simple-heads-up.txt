Dear $title $lastname, 

This is Bro. David Vezzani from the Vineyard 1st Ward.  I hope that things are well with you.

I'm reaching out on behalf of Pres. Smith (Elders Quorum president).  As a presidency, we enjoy making visits to get to know members better in the ward and our community.  

What time would work best for you for such a meeting with members of the Elders Quorum presidency?  This should be a brief visit and take no more than 20 minutes.  

Feel free to contact me at your convenience.

Thanks!

Sincerely,

-- Bro. Vezzani (Elders Quorum Secretary)

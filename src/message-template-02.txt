Dear $title $lastname, 

This is Bro. David Vezzani from the Vineyard 1st Ward.  I hope that the weekend has been good to you.

I'm reaching out on behalf of Pres. Smith (Elders Quorum president).  As a presidency, we enjoy making visits to get to know members better in the ward and our community.  

Would you be available tomorrow ($visitDate) for such a visit?  

If tomorrow isn't a good time, let me know when you would be more available and we can schedule a better time.

Thanks!

Sincerely,

-- Bro. Vezzani (Elders Quorum Secretary)

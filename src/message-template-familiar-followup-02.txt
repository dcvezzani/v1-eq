Dear $title $lastname, 

This is Bro. David Vezzani from the Vineyard 1st Ward.  I hope that you have been enjoying a wonderful week.

Not long ago I asked if you would be amenable to a visit from the Elders Quorum presidency.  How would $visitTime on $visitDate work for you? 

Let me know and I can schedule the visit or we can schedule a better time that works for you.

We look forward to visiting with you soon.

Sincerely,

-- Bro. Vezzani (Elders Quorum Secretary)
